# Basic sentiment Analytics using Spark streaming API

Description: 
* This project demonstrates a basic sentiment application using the spark streaming API and Kafka in python.
* Kafka provides a distributed queuing service, which in this project is used to buffer the tweets before processing.
* Kafka comes in handy when the data creation rate is more than the processing rate.
